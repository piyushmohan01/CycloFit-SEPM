## Configuration :
- On windows, you can configure the app using the batch file `$ setup.bat` 
- The batch file has the following commands in order :
```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv env
env\Scripts\activate
```
- Use `source env/bin/activate` for Linux/Mac OS
- Once, env is activated install the requirements with :
```

```
- Once all the packages are installed, run the app using :
```python
run.py
```
- Click on the ip address displayed on the terminal
- The app launches on your devices local ipv4 address 
- The app launches on your device's local ipv4 address
- Since, the app is MOBILE-ONLY currently, you'd have to do the following :

  1. Connect your phone to the same Wifi network as your wide screen device
  1. Open your browser on the phone and type in the content that you see on your wide screen's URL
  1. It would be something like `192.x.x.x:5000` (Make sure you're connected to the internet)
 
- The app should now be working on your mobile device and you can ofcourse, use it now!
- In order to let the app send password reset mails, turn on the permissions for less secure apps from your google account. (You can always turn it back off once the password has updated on the app)
